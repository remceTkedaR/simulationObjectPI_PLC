# [TIA Portal PLC S7 Simulation PI](http://electronic.pythonanywhere.com/)


## Description
The program communicates with the PLC Siemens S7 1200 (300).

Generates a variable that simulates a PI controller.
Changes in the output parameter are calculated by the modified PI controller.
The input signal, on the basis of which the controller calculates a new value,
the simulated value is the current Hz on the inverter.
